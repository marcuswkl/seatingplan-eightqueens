# ai-problems

Implement one search algorithm for each of the problems using Python.

### Problem 1 - Seating Plan
Five people are to be seated on five chairs that are arranged to form a circle. Due to the different personalities and closeness between different people, the comfortability of a person is different when seated next to different people. You are asked to identify the seating arrangement that allows everyone to be as comfortable as they can.

### Problem 2 - 8-queens
In chess, the queen may move unlimited steps in 8 directions â€“ up, down, left, right, and all diagonals to remove other pieces. You are asked to identify (if existed) the placement of eight queens on an 8-by-8 chess board such that no queen is able to remove other queens.

The code that has been written should:
- Execute without error
- Consider different number of people for problem 1, and different number of queens for problem 2 (the number of queens and the number of rows and columns of the board are always the same)
- Provide a way for user to input the number of people for problem 1 and the number of queens/size of the board
- Provide a visualisation of the final result
